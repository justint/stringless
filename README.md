# Stringless
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/justint/stringless.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/justint/stringless)

![Stringless demo](stringless.gif)

Stringless is a real-time, markerless, single-camera facial motion capture system. By using [dlib](http://dlib.net/) facial landmark detection, Stringless captures facial motion data as a collection of data points and sends it to an Autodesk Maya plug-in, where a user can map the motion capture data to a rigged face model. It was originally built as a pseudo-thesis project for my CS undergraduate degree at SJSU, but is now a continual work in progress with updates and added features.

For an overview of the system's design, operation flow, and current issues, please see [this presentation](http://justintennant.me/Stringless_NASA_Presentation.pdf), which was given live at the NASA Ames Research Center in June 2017.

I accept pull requests, and issues for bugs + feature requests are welcome.

## Build instructions

### Server

Stringless server requires [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) and [dlib](http://dlib.net).

1. Clone a copy of Stringless:

    `$ git clone https://github.com/octop1/stringless.git`

2. Make a build directory and compile:

    ```
    $ cd stringless

    $ mkdir build

    $ cd build

    $ cmake .. -DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=ON

    $ make
    ```

### Maya plug-in

The Maya plug-in requires the Maya API unique to your version of Maya. I built it using Maya 2016.5 if you run into issues compiling with other versions [please let me know](https://github.com/justint/stringless/issues)!

## Running Stringless

To initiate the server process using the default camera (camera 0):

`$ src/Stringless -p ../ext/dlib/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`

Use the `-cn=<arg>` flag to specify a different camera.

To start up the Maya plug-in:

1. Load up the Stringless plug-in, copy the MEL script into your Maya scripts directory
2. Enter `source StringlessMaya` into the MEL command line
3. Enter `createStringlessCap "<name>"` into the MEL command line

### Optimizing performance

Use the `-d`/`--dsr` flag to specify a downsample ratio. This scales down the captured image frames, speeding up face detection greatly.

*Example*: `./Stringless ... -d 2` will scale down the image by a half (1/**2**).

Use the `-s`/`--sr` flag to specify a sampling rate for face detection. By default Stringless attempts to detect faces in every frame, but if the actor is keeping their head fairly still during captures, the interval between sampled frames can be raised without any noticeable drop in capture quality.

*Example*: `./Stringless ... -s 3` will look for faces every three frames, and will use the face location data from the previously sampled frame to define the facial landmark detection region.

When compiling Stringless, it is important to use the `-DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=ON` flag with cmake - this instructs your compiler to use specially optimized [Advanced Vector Extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) instructions, which came about in early 2011. If you're using a pre-2011 CPU, use the `-DUSE_SSE4_INSTRUCTIONS=ON` flag instead (the next best optimal instructions).
