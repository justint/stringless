# libaries against which the plug-ins is linked.
#
# Here's why:
#
# Plug-ins are written by separate developers. Each of them might
# want to use various libraries to implement their plug-ins. At
# times, it occurs that plug-ins written by different developers are
# using different and "incompatible" versions of the same library. To
# support this, we recommend that plug-ins be linked against static
# versions of these libraries. And, by hidding the symbols of these
# libraries, we prevent the two incompatible versions of the library
# from interferring with each others.
